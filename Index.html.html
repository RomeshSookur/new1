<h2><strong>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p class="solid">Curtin University is committed to supporting all our students and staff whether they are on campus, working
remotely or overseas. Your health, safety and wellbeing are our priority and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic
may require changes to the unit schedule, learning activities, delivery modes and assessment to provide flexible
and safe options to our community. Curtin will endeavour to keep changes and disruptions to a minimum at all

 <h2><strong>Syllabus</strong></h2>
 <p></p>
 <p class="solid">The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development
methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools.</p>

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p class="solid">Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible webbased
applications.</p>

<h2><strong>Unit learning Outcomes</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These
inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.</P>
<p>Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities
through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.</P>

<h2><strong>Assessment Moderation</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Fair Assessment through moderation</strong></h3>
<p>Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning
outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation
of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from <a href="policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/">policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/</a></p>
 
<h3><strong>Pre-Marking Moderation</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and
confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking
criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to
ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.</p>

<h3><strong>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit:</p>
<p> *Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries</p>
<p> *Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where
students have not met the pass requirements</p>
<p>*Analysis of the variances between markers and locations</p>
<p>*Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards</p>
 
 
 <h3><strong>Late Assessment</strong></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p>Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in this unit.</p>
 <p>Where a late assessment is permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the Assessment
Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>
 
 <p>1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For assessment items submitted within the first 24 hours after the due date/time, students will be penalised
by a deduction of 5% of the total marks allocated for the assessment task;</P>
 <p>2. &nbsp &nbsp& For each additional 24 hour period commenced an additional penalty of 10% of the total marks allocated
for the assessment item will be deducted; and</p>
 <p>3. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Assessment items submitted more than 168 hours late (7 calendar days) will receive a mark of zero.</p>
 
 <p>Where late assessment <strong>is NOT</strong> permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the
Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will receive a mark of zero.</p>
 
 <h3><strong>Assessment extension</strong></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p>Where an application for an assessment extension is permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit (refer to
the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):</p>
 <p> 1. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A student who is unable to complete an assessment item by/on the due date/time as a result of exceptional
circumstances beyond the student’s control, may apply for an assessment extension on the Assessment
Extension Application Form as prescribed by the Academic Registrar. The form is available on the Forms
page at <a href="https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/forms/">https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/forms/</a> and also within the student's

documentation <a href="https://students.connect.curtin.edu.au/app/assessment_extension"> via the online form.</a></p>
 <p> 3. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Timely submission of this information supports the assessment process. For applications that are declined,
delayed submission may have significant ramifications on the possible marks awarded.</P>
<p> 4. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An application may be accepted up to five working days after the due date/time of the assessment item
where the student is able to provide a verifiable explanation as to why they were not able to submit the
application prior to the assessment due date/time. </p>
<p>Where an application for an assessment extension <strong>is NOT </strong> permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit

may also be eligible for support. This support can include alternative exam or test arrangements, study materials
in accessible formats, access to Curtin's facilities and services or other support as discussed with an advisor from <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/students/personal-support/disability/">
AccessAbility Services.</a></p>
